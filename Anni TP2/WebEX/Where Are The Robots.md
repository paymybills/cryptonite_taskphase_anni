# PicoCTF Challenge: Where Are the Robots

### Challenge Description:
In this challenge, we need to find the flag by exploring the `robots.txt` file of a website.

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Access the Challenge:**
   - Start by visiting the provided link to the challenge site. You will see a blank page with the heading "Welcome, Where are the robots?"

2. **Inspect the Robots.txt File:**
   - The mention of "robots" suggests looking at the `robots.txt` file, which tells search engine crawlers which URLs they can access on the site.
   - To access this file, add `/robots.txt` to the URL of the site.

3. **Analyze the Robots.txt File:**
   - In the `robots.txt` file, look for the `Disallow` directive. This directive lists URLs that the site owner does not want crawlers to access.
   - In this case, the file disallows access to `/8028f.html`.

4. **Access the Disallowed Page:**
   - Add `/8028f.html` to the site's URL to access the disallowed page.

5. **Capture the Flag:**
   - The flag for this challenge is found on the disallowed page.
