### **What's Really Happening?**

- Characters are **split into two groups** based on whether their ASCII values are **prime**.
- **Non-prime characters** are encrypted with **RSA**, which requires **factoring, modular arithmetic, and key calculation** to decrypt.
- **Prime characters** are turned into **Greek symbols** and then scrambled. Decoding them involves **reverse alphabet mappings** and **Greek-English conversions**.
- The two groups are **merged back** into the flag.

### So dealing with the separation first:

```python
with open('out.txt', 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()

# Split sections
chars = data.split("ct:")[0].strip()
cts = data.split("ct:")[1].split("n:")[0].strip().split(',')
n_vals = data.split("n:")[1].strip().split(',')

# Write to files
with open('greek.txt', 'w') as f: f.write(chars)
with open('cipher.txt', 'w') as f: f.write(' '.join(cts))
with open('modulus.txt', 'w') as f: f.write(' '.join(n_vals))

```

Now the entire RSA part using n=pq so on so forth

```python
from sympy import mod_inverse, factorint

def get_pq(n):
    factors = factorint(n)
    return list(factors.keys())  # Returns p and q

def rsa_decrypt(ct, n, e=65537):
    p, q = get_pq(n)
    phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
    d = mod_inverse(e, phi)
    return pow(ct, d, n)

```

For **prime characters**:

- They are **transformed into Greek symbols** during encryption.
- They also undergo a **custom transformation** called **"googly"** (likely a substitution or scrambling).

**Reverse steps**:

1. Identify the **Greek-to-English** mapping.
2. Reverse any **alphabet substitution** (flip ASCII values).

### **Reverse Alphabet Mapping:**

```python
def reverse_alphabet(char):
    if char.isupper():
        return chr(155 - ord(char))  # Example: 'A' -> 'Z'
    elif char.islower():
        return chr(219 - ord(char))  # Example: 'a' -> 'z'
    else:
        return char

```

After this just recombine and decode
